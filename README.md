# TNBC_spatialTranscriptomics
Breast cancer is a multifaceted disease with distinct biological subtypes characterized by diverse clinical, pathological, and molecular features that influence prognosis and therapeutic outcomes. Notably, subtype discordance between primary and metastatic tumors directly impacts therapeutic success. We applied GeoMx spatial transcriptomics across three clinical states represented by non-metastatic, metastatic primariy, and lymph-node metastases, to resolve transcriptional and immune–spatial reprogramming along this trajectory. In this study, we dissect the tumor heterogeneity of 19 TNBC breast cancer patients that included 6 non-metastatic, 10 primary with matched lymph node metastatic and 3 unmatched TNBC.
